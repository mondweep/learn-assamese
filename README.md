# Learn Assamese - Language Learning Platform

A modern, AI-powered language learning platform designed to help Assamese diaspora communities preserve their cultural heritage and maintain connection to their roots.

Assamese diaspora communities are growing worldwide, creating a cultural disconnect between generations. This platform provides a reliable, engaging, mainstream resource for learning Assamese language and culture, addressing the lack of such tools in existing platforms like Duolingo.

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)

- 🗣️ **AI-Powered Speech Recognition** - Practice pronunciation with real-time feedback
- 🎮 **Gamified Learning** - Duolingo-style engagement mechanics
- 📚 **Comprehensive Curriculum** - From beginner to advanced Assamese
- 🎨 **Cultural Integration** - Learn language through cultural context
- 🤖 **AI Conversation Practice** - Chat with AI in Assamese
- 📱 **Cross-Platform** - Web, iOS, and Android apps
- 🌍 **Built for Diaspora** - Understanding the unique needs of heritage language learners
